    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>We will learn how to use Version Control System (<strong>VCS</strong>). I will be using <strong>Git</strong> for this tutorial.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Who should use Git?</h3>
    <p>You do not have to be a programmer to use Git. Anyone who works on projects and wants to maintain its different 
       versions, can use <br> 
       <ul>
            You may be
           <li>A writer who writes stories or books.</li>
           <li>A programmer </li>
           <li>A Student</li>
           <li>or Anyone</li>
       </ul>

    </p>
    <h3>Version Control System</h3>
    <p>Before preceding, lets find out what actually is VCS and what is Git?</p>
    <p>Simply put, version control system allows you to maintain and manage different versions of files. It is sort of a 
       time machine. Yes!, you read it right. Once you master the VCS you will be able to travel in time. You will be able
       to see what your files looked like in the past. You will be maintaining different versions for your future self. 
       Is not it fun? So, fasten your seat belts.</p>
    
    <h3>Git and Github</h3>
    <p>There are many Version Control Systems out there. Git is one of them. So, Git is a Version Control System. It lets
       you mantain different versions locally in your machine.<br>
       Github is basically a cloud storage platform where you can store your files in repositries. You can access them 
       from anywhere in the world and from any machine in the world.</p>

    <h4>Installation Guide:</h3>
    <h4>Github for Windows:</h4>
    <a href="https://windows.github.com" target="_blank">https://windows.github.com</a>
    <h4>Github for Mac:</h4>
    <a href="https://mac.github.com" target="_blank">https://mac.github.com</a>
    <p>Download the setup and install it on your computer.</p>
    <p>After installing open command prompt or shell and type
       <strong><br> git --version </strong></em>
       <p>You will see the following result if the installation was successfull. Note: Your version might be different.</p> 
    </p>

    <hr>
    <p>Now that we have installed git, lets move towards learnin how to use it.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>git init</h3>
    <p>Open the folder that contains the files, you want to manage different versions of, inside the terminal and type
       <br> <strong>git init</strong><br>
        Executing this command will initialize that folder as a Git repository.
        <br>
    </p>
    <img src="images/init1.png">
    <img src="images/init2.png">
   <hr>
   <p>Now, suppose you are inside the repository. What will be the process? <br>
      Have a look at the image below
      <ul>
         <li>Your working directory is the area where you will be working on the files.</li>
         <li>Then you will add this file into staging area. Here it keeps track of the changes being made.</li>
         <li>Then you will commit it and it's version will be stored in the local repository.</li>
      </ul>
   </p>
   <img src="images/generalConcept.png">
   <hr>
   <h3>git status</h3>
   <p>This command shows the files that are being tracked and that are not being tracked. <br>
      For the files that are being tracked it also shows if any chnages have been made to them that are not 
      yet saved in the local repository.</p>
   <img src="images/status.png">
   <hr>
   <h3>git add</h3>
   <p>Files can be added in the staging area using two ways
      <ul>
         <li>Add a single file</li>
         <li>Add all files at once</li>
      </ul>
      <br> <strong>git add [file name]</strong><br>
      adds the single file into staging area.
      <br>
   </p>
   <img src="images/add1.png">
   <p>
      <br> <strong>git add .</strong><br>
      adds all the files and subdirectories in current directory to staging area. 
      <br></p>
      <img src="images/add2.png">
   <p>Now both files are being tracked <br>
      Lets make some changes in the files</p>
   <img src="images/change1.png">
   <img src="images/change1Commit.png">

   <h3>git commit</h3>
   <p>This command will move all the files in the staging area to local repository. It means it will store the current 
      version.
      <br> <strong>git commit -m message</strong><br>
      Message is a note which will help you remember what change you made in this commit.
      <br>
   </p>
   <img src="images/spring.png">
   <p>Lets make some changes and commit them.</p>
   <img src="images/change2.png">
   <br>
   <img src="images/change2Commit.png">
   <br>
   <img src="images/change3.png">
   <br>
   <img src="images/change3Commit.png">   
<hr>
<h3>git log</h3>
<p>This command shows the track of commit. It shows when the commit was made, who made the commit and commit message. 
   <br>
   <img src="images/log.png">   
</p>

<p>Let say we want se how our directory looked at first commit.
    <br>
   For this we would have to copy the hash code of the commit and type
   <br><Strong>git checkout "commit hash code" </Strong>
   </p>
   <img src="images/checkout1.png">   
   <img src="images/checkout2.png">   
   <p>To swicth back to recent state, type
   <br><Strong>git checkout master </Strong>
   </p>

   <h3>Lets learn about branches now. What are branches?</h3>
   <p>Branches enables you to make changes in the project without affecting the existing
      project. Sometimes you make some changes and those chnages create turbulence in the project. So, your prject becomes 
      unstable. The only way now is to revert back but how can we do that. We will have to remember how it looked like back 
      then. Git branches makes it way more easier for you.
      Master branch is the main branch. Whenever you want to make changes to your project that might make it unstable, create
      a branch. It copy all the files in that branch. So basically it generated a copy of the project. You can make changes
      in it. Whenever you think that the changes are sable you can merge the both branches otherwise you can simply switch 
      to previous branch.
   </p>
   <img src="images/branch.png"> 
   <h3>git branch</h3>
   <p>It tells you which branch you are on. </p>
   <br>
   <img src="images/branch1.png">  
   
   <h3>git branch [branch-name]</h3>
   <p>It will create a new branch with the specified name.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="images/branch2.png"> 

   <h3>git checkout [branch-name]</h3>
   <p>Switches to the branch specified.</p>

   <h2>GitHub</h2>
   <p>Now, that we have leanred git lets move on to GitHub. 
      <br>
      GitHub is a cloud storag platform, where you can store your repositries and can access them from anywhere.
      <br>
      <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
      <br>
      Open the above link and create your account on GitHub. <br>
      Click on new for creating a new repository.
      <img src="images/githubRepo1.png">
      <br>
      Enter the name and description and click create repository.
      <img src="images/githubRepo2.png">
      <br>
      Follow these instructions to upload your local repository to GitHub.

   <img src="images/githubRepo4.png" >
   <br><br>
   <img src="images/githubRepo5.png" >
   <br>
   <p>You can see that our repository is uploaded.</p>
   <br>
   <img src="images/githubRepo6.png" >
   <br>
   <p>You can also view commits.</p><br>

   <h3>How to download an existing GitHub repoitory on you local machine?</h3>
   <p>
      <ul>
         <li>Move to the directory you want to clone the repository in.</li>
         <li>Open Terminal and Enter following commands</li>
         <li>git init</li>
         <li>git clone [url of repository]</li>
      </ul>

   <p>Suppose I or someone make changes in repsoitory on GitHub. How will my local repository gets updated?</p>
   <h3>git pull</h3>
   <p>It will update the local repsoitory.</p>
